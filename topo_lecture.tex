\section{Cup-product}


Let \(X\) be a simplicial set, and \(R\)\footnote{A ring is not necessarily commutative, but has a unit} a ring\index{ring}.
\[C^n(X, R) = \mathrm{maps}(X_n, R)\]
is an abelian group under pointwise addition. There is a differential
\[d^n\colon C^n(X,R) \to C^{n+1}(X,R)\]
given by
\[d^n(f)(y) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n+1}(-1)^{i} f(d_i^*(y))\]
with \(f\colon X_n \to R, y \in X_{n+1}\)


\begin{construction}[Cup product/Alexander Whitney map]
    \index{cup-product}\index{Alexander Whitney map}
    The cup prodcut/Alexander Withney map
    \[\cup\colon C^n(X,R) \times C^m(X,R) \to C^{m+n}(X,R)\]
    with \(n,m \geq 0\) is defined by
    \[(f\cup g)(x)\coloneq f(d_{front}^*(x)) \cdot g(d_{back}^*(x))\]
    with \(f\colon X_n \to R, g\colon X_m \to R\), \(x \in X_{n+m}\).

    Where we use \([n+m] = \set{0,1,\dots, n+m}\) and \(d_{front} \colon [n] \to [n+m], d_{back}\colon [m]\to [n+m]\) are given by \(d_{front}(i) = i\), \(d_{back}(i) = n+i\). Note, that \(d_{front}\) and \(d_{back}\) respectively suppress in their noation \(n\) and \(m\).
\end{construction}

\begin{thm}{fundamental properties of cup product}{fpcp}
    The cup-product satisfies the following properties.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The AW-map is biadditive and satisfies a boundary formula:
        \[d(f\cup g) = (df) \cup g + (-1)^n f \cup (dg) \in C^{m+n+1}(X,R)\]
        \item Associativity: For \(h \in C^k(X, R)\), \((f \cup g) \cup h = f \cup (g\cup h) \in C^{n+m+k}(X,R)\).
        
        Let \(1 \in C^0(X,R)\) be the constant function \(1\colon X_0 \to R\) with value 1. Then \(1 \cup f = f\cup 1 = f\).
        \item Naturality: Let \(\alpha \colon Y \to X\) be a morphism of symplicial sets. Then
        \[\alpha^*(f \cup g) = \alpha^*(f) \cup \alpha^*(g), \quad \alpha^*(1) = 1.\]
        where \(\alpha^*\colon C^n(X,R) \to C^n(Y,R), \quad f \mapsto f\circ \alpha_n\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}\leavevmode
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We check some properties: Let \(d_{front}\colon [n] \to [n+m]\), \(d_{back}\colon [m] \to [n+m]\) be as in the definition of \(\cup\). Then
        \[d_i \circ d_{front} = \begin{cases}
            d_{front} \circ d_i & 0 \leq i \leq n+1 \\
            d_{front} & n+1 \leq i \leq n+m+1 \\
        \end{cases}\]
        and
        \[d_i \circ d_{back} = \begin{cases}
            d_{back} \circ d_i & 0 \leq i \leq n \\
            d_{back} \circ d_{i-n} & n \leq i \leq n+m+1 \\
        \end{cases}\]
        Note, that for \(n+1\) and \(n\) respectively the cases are the same.

        Now we calculate
        \[\begin{split}
            d(f\cup g)(x) &= \sum_{i = 0}^{n+m+1}(-1)^{i} (f\cup g)(d_i^*(x)) \\
            &= \sum_{i = 0}^{n+m+1} (-1)^{i} \cdot f(d_{front}^*(x)) \cdot g(d_{back}^*(d_i^*(x))) \\
            = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} (-1)^{i} &\cdot f(d_{front}^*(d_i^*(x))) \cdot g(d_{back}^*(d_i^*(x))) + \sum_{j = 1}^{m+1} (-1)^{n+j} \cdot f(d_{front}^*(d_{j+n}^*(x))) \cdot g(d_{back}^*(d_{j+n}^*(x))) \\
            &= \sum_{i = 0}^{n+1}(-1)^{i} \cdot f(d_i^*(d_{front}^*(x))) \cdot g(d_{back}^*(x)) + \sum_{j = 0}^{m+1}(-1)^{n+j} f(d_{front}^*(x)) \cdot g(d_j^*(d_{back}^*(x))) \\
            &= d(f)(d_{front}^*(x)) \cdot g(d_{back}^*(x)) + (-1)^n \cdot f(d_{front}^*(x)) \cdot d(g)(d_{back}^*(x)) \\
            &= ((df) \cup g)(x) + (-1)^n \cdot (f\cup dg)(x)\\
            & = ((df) \cup g + (-1)^n \cdot f\cup (dg))(x)
        \end{split}\]

        \item For \(x \in X_{n+m+k}\) we see
        \[\begin{split}
            ((f\cup g) \cup h)(x) &= (f\cup g) (d_{front}^*(x)) \cdot h(d_{back}^*(x)) \\
            &= f(d_{front}^*(d_{front}^*(x))) \cdot g(d_{back}^*(d_{front}^*(x))) \cdot h(d_{back}^*(x))\\
            & = f(d_{front}^*(x)) \cdot g(d_{middle}^*(x)) \cdot h(d_{back}^*(x))
        \end{split}\]
        Note that we abuse that \(d_{front}\) suppresses the indices for which the map is the front map.
        We have in the last line
        \[d_{front}\colon[n] \to [n+m+k], d_{middle}\colon [m] \to [n+m+k], d_{back}\colon [k] \to [n+m+k]\]
        defined by
        \[d_{front}(i) = i, d_{middle}(i) = n+i, d_{back}(i) = n+m+i\]
        this is obviously associative in the inputs\footnote{for Schwede at least.}
        \item Naturality for \(\alpha\colon Y \to X\) we see
        \[\begin{split}
            (\alpha^*(f\cup g))(y) &= (f\cup g)(\alpha_{n+m}(y)) \\
            &= f(d_{front}^*(\alpha_{n+m}(y))) \cdot g(d_{back}^*(\alpha_{n+m}(y))) = f(\alpha_n(d_{front}^*(y))) \cdot g(\alpha_m(d_{back}^*(y))) \\
            &= \alpha^*(f)(d_{front}^*(y)) \cdot \alpha^*(g)(d_{back}^*(y)) \\
            &= (\alpha^*(f) \cup \alpha^*(g))(y).
        \end{split}\]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{defi}{Differential graded ring}{}
    A differential graded ring (dg-ring)\index{differential graded ring}\index{graded ring} is a cochain-complex \(A = \set{A^n, d^n}_{n \in \IZ}\) equipped with biadditive maps
    \[\cdot\colon A^n \times A^m \to A^{n+m}, \quad n,m \in \IZ \]
    and a unit \(1 \in A^0\), such that;
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\cdot\) is associative and has \(1\) as a unit element.
        \item the Leibniz rule holds:
        \[d(a\cdot b) = (da) \cdot b + (-1)^n \cdot a \cdot (db)\]
        with \(a \in A^n, b \in A^m\).\footnote{The sign is somehow connected to a sign-rule I couldn't follow. The d moved past the a or something.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{defi}

\begin{example}
    Some Differential graded rings are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(C^\cdot(X,R)\) for a simplicial set \(X\) and a ring \(R\).
        \item De Rham complex of a smooth manifold.
    \end{itemize}

\end{example}

\begin{construction}[Cup-Product on cohomology]\index{cup-product}
    Let \(A = (A^n, d, \cdot)\) be a dg-ring. We define a map
    \[\cdot \colon H^n(A) \times H^m(A) \to H^{n+m}(A), \quad [a] \cdot [b] = [a \cdot b]\]

    This is well defined:
    \[d(a\cdot b) = \underset{= 0}{(da)} \cdot b + (-1)^n @. a \cdot \underset{= 0}{(db)} = 0\]
    so \(a\cdot b\) is a cycle and we can take its homology class. Let \(x \in A^{n-1}\).
    \[(a+ dx) \cdot b = a\cdot b + (dx) \cdot b = a \cdot b + d(x\cdot b) = [(a+dx)\cdot b] = [a \cdot b]\]
    so it only depends on the cohomology class of \(a\), analogous for \(b\).

    The product on cohomology inherits associativity and unity with \(1 = [1] \in H^0(A)\). We need to see \(1\) is a cocycle:
    \[d(1) = d(1\cdot 1) = (d1) \cdot 1 + (-1)^0 1 \cdot (d1) = 2 \cdot d(1)\]
    and so \(d(1) = 0\).

    The cup product on the \(R\)-cohomology of a simplicial set \(X\) is the product induced by the cup product on \(C^*(X,R)\) in \(H^*(C(X,R)) = H^*(X,R)\).
\end{construction}

\begin{thm}{Properties of the cup-product on homology}{}
    Let \(X\) be a simplicial set and \(R\) a ring. Then
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The cup product on \(H^*(X,R)\) is associative and unital, with unit the cohomology class of the constant function \(1\colon X_0 \to R\).
        \item For a morphism of simplicial sets \(\alpha\colon Y \to X\), the relation
        \[\alpha^*([x] \cup [y]) = \alpha^*[X] \cup \alpha^*[y]\]
        holds for all \([x] \in H^n(X,R), [y] \in H^m(X,R)\).
    \end{itemize}
\end{thm}

\begin{remark}
    The cup product generalizes to relative cohomology: For \(A, B\) simplicial subsets of \(X\). We have
    \[C^n(X,A;R) = \set{f\colon X_n\to R \mid f(A_n) = \set{0}}\]
    The relative cup product is the restriciton of \(\cup\) on \(C^*(X,R)\) to
    \[C^n(X,A;R) \times C^m(X,B;R) \xrightarrow{\cup} C^{n+m}(X,A\cup B;R).\]
    Let \(x \in (A \cup B)_{n+m}\), then
    \[(f\cup g)(x) = f(d_{front}^*(x)) \cdot g(d_{back}^*(x))\]
    if \(x \in A_{n+m}\) then \(f(d_{front}^*(x)) = 0\) and analogous with \(B_{n+m}\), anyways the product is 0.

    This gives us biadditive well defined maps
    \[\cup \colon H^n(X,A;R) \times H^n(X,B;R) \to H^{n+m}(X,A\cup B; R)\]

    In particular for \(A = B\) we get
    \[\cup\colon H^n(X,A;R) \times H^n(X,A;R) \to H^{n+m}(X,A;R)\]
    which is well defined and associative, but not unital anymore.
\end{remark}

\section{Commutativity of the cup-product}

\begin{thm}{Commutativity of the cup-product}{}
    Let \(X\) be a simplicial set and \(R\) a commutative ring. Then for all \([x] \in H^n(X,R); [y] \in H^m(X,R)\) the realtion
    \[[x] \cup [y] = (-1)^{n\cdot m} \cdot [y] \cup [x]\]
    holds.
\end{thm}

Schwede points out, that the easy way doesn't work.
\textbf{Warning.} For \(f \in C^n(X,R), g \in C^m(Y,R)\), then in general \(f\cup g \neq (-1)^{n+m} (g\cup f)\) in \(C^{n+m}(X,R)\). The commutativity is a property we only get on homology.


\begin{construction}
    The \(\cup_1\)-product (spoken Cup-one)
    \[\cup_1\colon C^n(X,R) \times C^m(X,R) \to C^{n+m-1}(X,R)\]
    is defined by
    \[(f\cup_1 g)(x) = \sum_{i =0}^{n-1} (-1)^{(n-1)\cdot (m+1)} f((d_i^{out})^*(x)) \cdot g((d_i^{inner})^*(x))\]
    for \(f\in C^n\), \(g \in C^m\) and \(x \in X_{n+m-1}\).\footnote{There are also \(\cup_i\) for \(i \in \IN\). However, they are quite messy and combinatorical.}
    where \(d_i^{out}\colon [n] \to [n+m-1], d_i^{inner}\colon [m] \to [n+m-1]\) are the unique monotone injective maps with images \(\img(d_i^{out}) = \set{0, \dots, i} \cup \set{i+m, \dots, n+m-1}\) and \(\img(d_i^{inn}) = \set{i, \dots, i+m}\).
\end{construction}

\begin{thm}{\(\cup_1\)-Product}{}
    The \(\cup_1\)-product satisfies the following formula
    \[d(f\cup_1 g) = (df) \cup_1 g + (-1)^n \cdot f \cup_1 (dg) - (-1)^{n+m}(f\cup g) - (-1)^{n+1}{m+1}(g\cup f)\]
    for \(f \in C^n(X,R)\) and \(g \in C^m(X,R)\).
\end{thm}

\begin{remark}
    What we want to see, is that \(f\cup g\) and \(g\cup f\) are not the same but rather homotopic, and \(\cup_1\) wittnesses that homotopy.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
    This theorem will not be prooven, because it is quite messy. You should find a lecture-video for that.
\end{proof}

Now suppose that \(f\) and \(g\) are cocycles, i.e. \(df = 0\), \(dg = 0\). Then
\[d(f\cup_1 g) = -(-1)^{n+m}(f\cup g) - (-1)^{(n+1)(m+1)}(g\cup f) \]
and we get
\[(-1)^{n+m+1}\cdot d(f\cup_1 g) = f\cup g - (-1)^{n \cdot m} (g\cup f)\] and as such
\[0 = [(-1)^{n+m-1}] = [f] \cup [g] - (-1)^{n\cdot m} [g] \cup [f]\]

\begin{remark}
    Last term we discussed the tensor product of two chain complexes (in an exercise):
    \[(C\otimes D)_n = \bigoplus_{p+q = n} C_p \otimes D_q\]
    and differential
    \[d(x\otimes y) = (dx) \otimes y + (-1)^{\abs{x}} \cdot x \otimes (dy)\]
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    Reinterpretation of \(d(f \cup_1 g)\).
    The cup product yields a morphism of cochain complexes
    \[C^*(X,R) \otimes C^*(X,R) \to C^*(X,R)\]
    and we get a diagram
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        x \otimes y \ar[d] & C^*(X,R) \otimes C^*(X,R) \ar[r, "\cup"] \ar[d] & C^*(X,R) \\
        y \otimes x & C^*(X,R) \otimes C^*(X,R) \ar[ru, "\cup"] & \\
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    that does not commute, however it does so up to cochain homotopy and \(\cup_1\) is exactly a cochain homotopy between the two maps.
\end{remark}


\newLecture{09.04.2025}


Only with the definition of the cup-product we cannot calculate a lot yet. Some methods to compute cup-products are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item directly from the definition
    \item cellular approximation of the diagonal (whatever that means, he gives a little intuition I failed to record.) (this might be used later)
    \item Group homology (one exapmle later today, something for AT I)
    \item Poincar√© duality (later this term)
    \item Analysis on smooth manifolds together with De Rahm Cohomology 
\end{itemize}
The first two methods are not very practical.

\begin{example}
    Let \(X\) be a discrete space, Then \(\cS(X)\) is a constant simplicial set. The chain complex has the form
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        \ar[r, "0"] & \IZ[X] \ar[r, "="] & \IZ[X] \ar[r, "0"] & \IZ[X]\\
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    And so \(H^n(X,R) = 0\) for \(n \geq 0\).
    And only for \(n = m = 0\) something nontrivial happens. for \(f\colon X_0 \to R, g\colon X_0 \to R\), we have \((f\cup g)(x) = f(d_{front}^*(x)) \cdot g(d_{back}^*(x)) = f(x) \cdot g(x)\)
    and so the cup product is just pointwise multiplication in dimension \(0\).

    More generally: \(H^0(X,R) = \mathrm{maps}(\pi_0(X),R)\) with \(\cup\)-prodcut pointwise multiplication
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Let \(G\) be a group: Define a category \(\underline{G}\)\footnote{via geometric realization, these define interesting spaces, namely some (missed word)-Maclane spaces \(M(G,1)\), didn't catch it all} wit one object \(*\) and \(\Hom_{\underline{G}}(*,*) = G\). We then define
    \[BG = N(\underline{G})\]
    Where \(N\) is the Nerve-Functor \(\mathbf{CAT} \to \mathbf{Sset}\).
    Then
    \[(BG)_n = G^n, \quad d_i^*\colon G^n \to G^{n-1} (g_1, \dots, g_n) \mapsto \begin{cases}
        (g_2, \dots, g_n) & i = 0 \\
        (g_1, \dots, g_i \circ g_{i+1}, \dots, g_n) & 1 \leq i \leq n-1 \\
        (g_1, \dots , g_{n-1}) & i = n \\
    \end{cases}\]
    And \(s_i(g_1, \dots, g_n) = (g_1, \dots, g_i, 1, g_{i+1}, \dots, g_n)\).

    The general case of this is too hard to calculate. We take \(G = (\IF_2, +)\) and \(R = \IF_2\) and we calculate \(H^*(B\IF_2, \IF_2)\).
    We see
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        {C^0(BG,A)} \ar[r, "d"] \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "= "] & C^1(BG,A) \ar[r, "d"] \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "="] & C^2(BG,A) \ar[r] \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "="] & \dots \\
        \mathrm{maps}(\{1\},A) \ar[r, "0"] \ar[d, sloped, phantom, "\cong"] & \mathrm{maps}(G,A) \ar[r] & \mathrm{maps}(G^2,A) & \\
        A &(f\colon G \to A) \ar[r]&(df)(g,h) & \\
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    And the map is defined by
    \[f(d_0^*(g,h)) - f(d_1^*(g,h)) + f(d_2^*(g,h)) = f(h) - f(g\cdot h) + f(g)\]
    and 
    \[df = 0 \Lra f(g,h) = f(g) + f(h)\]
    \(\implies\) 1-cocycles are the group homomorphisms from \(G\) to \(A\)
    \[H^1(BG,A) \cong \Hom(G,A)\]
    and  for \(G = (\IF_2, +)\), \(A = \IF_2\)
    
    We define
    \[0 \neq x \coloneq [\Id_{\IF_2}] \in H^1(B\IF_2, \IF_2).\]
    We will show that \(x^n = x \cup \dots \cup x\) (\(n\)-times) \(\in H^n(B\IF_2, \IF_2)\) is nonzero.
    \begin{Proposition}
        \(x^n \in H^n(B\IF_2, \IF_2)\) is represented by
        \[f_n \colon (\IF_2)^n \to \IF_2, f_n(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n) = \lambda_1 \cdot \dots \cdot \lambda_n = \begin{cases}
            1 & \text{if } \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \dots = \lambda_n = 1 \\
            0 & \text{else}
        \end{cases}\]
    \end{Proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        By induction on \(n\). We checked for \(n = 1\).
        For \(n \geq 2\) we have
        \[\begin{split}
            x^n &= x^{n-1} \cup x = [f_{n-1}] \cup [\Id_{\IF_2}] \\
            &= [f_{n-1} \cup \Id] \\
        \end{split}\]
        Then
        \[\begin{split}
            (f_{n-1} \cup \Id)(\lambda_1 , \dots, \lambda_n) &= f_{n-1}(d_{front}^*(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n)) \cdot \Id_(d_{back}^*(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n)) \\
            &= f_{n-1}(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda{n-1}) \cdot \Id(\lambda_n) \\
            &= (\lambda_1 \cdot \dots \cdot \lambda_{n-1}) \cdot \lambda_n \\
        \end{split}\]
    \end{proof}

    Claim: \(x^n \neq 0\). In the UCT for cohomology we used the evaluation pair
    \[\Phi\colon H^n(X,A) \to \Hom(H_n(X;\IZ);A), \quad [f_n\colon X_n \to A] \mapsto \set*{[\sum b_ix_i] \mapsto \sum b_i f(x_i)}\]
    for \(b_i \in \IZ, x_i \in X_n\).
    We can slightly variate that for ring coefficients:
    \[\Phi\colon H^n(X,R) \to \Hom(H_n(X,R), R)\]
    and \([f\colon X_n \to R] \mapsto \set{[\sum r_i \cdot x_i] \mapsto \sum r_i \cdot f(x_i)}\) with \(r_i \in R, x_i \in X_n\).

    With \(X = B\IF_2, R = \IF_2\), we consider
    \[y\coloneq \sum_{(\lambda_1 \dots, \lambda_n) \in (\IF_2)^n} 1 (\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n) \in \IF_2[(\IF_2)^n] = \IF_2[(B\IF_2)_n]\]
    Claim: \(y\) is an \(n\)-cycle in \(C_*(B\IF_2, \IF_2)\).
    \[\begin{split}
        dy &= \sum_{i = 0, \dots n} (-1)^{i} \cdot d_i^*(\sum_1\cdot (\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n)) \\
        &= \sum_{i = 0,\dots, n} \underbrace{\sum_{(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n) \in \IF_2^n} (-1)^{i} \cdot d_i^*(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n)}_{\text{cancel in pairs}} \\
        &= 0
    \end{split}\]
    Now
    \[d_0^*(0,\lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_n) = (\lambda_2, \dots \lambda_n) = d_0^*(1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_n)\]
    So
    \[\Phi(x^n) \colon H_n(B\IF_2, \IF_2) \to \IF_2\]
    \[\Phi(x^n)[y] = \Phi[f_n][\sum_{(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n) \in \IF_2^n}(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n)] = \sum_{(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n)} f_n(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n) = \sum_{(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n)} \lambda_1,\cdot \dots \cdot \lambda_n = 1 \neq 0\]
    and \([y] \neq 0\) in \(H_n(B\IF_2, \IF_2)\).

    We will later see, that in fact \(H^*(B\IF_2;\IF_2) = \IF_2[X]\).

    \begin{Remark}
        Let \(p\) be an odd prime. \(H^*(B\IF_p, \IF_p) = ?\).
        \[0 \neq x = [\Id_{\IF_p} \in H^1(B\IF_p; \IF_p)]\]
        still makes sense, but now there are more scalars and
        \[x^n = 0\]
        for \(n \geq 2\). The graded commutativity says:
        \[x\cup x = (-1)^{1\cdot 1} x \cup x = - x\cup x\]
        so if \(R\) is commutative, \(x \in H^n(X,R)\) and \(n\) is odd, then \(2\cdot(x\cup x) = 0\) in \(H^{2n}(X,R)\).
        And then \(2\cdot x^2 = 0 \Ra x^2 = 0\).

        Define \(h \colon \IF_p \times \IF_p \to \IF_p\) by 
        \[h(i,j) = \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{if } i + j < p \\
            1 & \text{if } i+ j \geq p \\
        \end{cases}\]
        where we write \(\IF_p = \set{0, \dots, p-1}\). Now \(h \in C^2(B\IF_p, \IF_p)\). Fact: \(dh = 0\) and \(0 \neq y \coloneq [h] \in H^2(B\IF_p, \IF_p)\).

        We then get (but do not proove)
        \[H^*(B\IF_p, \IF_p) = \Lambda(x) \otimes \IF_p[y]\] and
        \[H^{2n}(B\IF_p, \IF_p) = \IF_p \set{y^n}, \quad H^{2n+1}(B\IF_p, \IF_p) = \IF_p \set{xy^n}\]
    \end{Remark}

\section{K√ºnneth theorem}
\index{K√ºnneth theorem}
The K√ºnneth theorem is an algebraic relationship between \(H^*_*(X,R), H^*_*(Y,R)\) and \(H^*_*(X\times Y, R)\)\footnote{\(H_*^*\) denotes, that Schwede was too lazy to write the statement for homology and cohomology separately}.

Here is a simplest version in homology with field coefficients:
\begin{thm}{K√ºnneth, simple version}{}
    Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be spaces and \(k\) a field. Then
    \[H_n(X\times Y, k)\]
    is natural isomorphic to
    \[\bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(X,k) \otimes_k H_q(Y,k)\]
\end{thm}

\subsection{The Eilenberg-Zilber-theorem}

Let \(A,B\) be simplicial abelian groups. Then we get two natural chain homotopy equivalences
\[\begin{tikzcd}
    C_*(A) \otimes C_*(B) \ar[rr, bend left, "\text{Eilenberg-Zilber-Map}"] && C_*(A\otimes B) \ar[ll, bend left, "\text{Alexander Whitney map}"]
\end{tikzcd}\]

\begin{defi}{Simplicial abelian group}{}
    A \emph{simplicial abelian group} \index{simplicial abelian group} is a functor \(A\colon \Delta^{Op} \to \mathbf{Ab.Groups}\).
\end{defi}

\begin{remark}
    Equivalently a simplicial abelian group is a colleciton of abelian groups \(A_n\), and homomorphisms \(\alpha^*\colon A_m \to A_n\) for all \(\alpha\colon [n] \to [m]\) in \(\Delta\), s.t. \((\alpha\circ \beta)^* = \beta^* \circ \alpha^*\).

    Equivalently a simplicial abelian group is a simplical set endorsed with abelian group structure on the sets of \(n\)-simplices, such that all \(\alpha^*\) are homomorphisms.
\end{remark}


\begin{example}
    Let \(X\) be a simplicial set and \(A\) an abelian group. Then the composite
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        \Delta^{op} \ar[rr, bend left, "{A[X]}"]\ar[r, "X"] & (\mathbf{Sets}) \ar[r, "{{A[\_]}}"] & (\mathbf{ab.grps}) \\
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    is a simplicial abelian group.
\end{example}

\begin{construction}
    Let \(A\colon \Delta^{op} \to (\mathbf{ab.grps})\) be a simplicial abelian groups. Its \emph{chain complex} \(C_*(A)\) is the chain complex with \(C_n(A) = A_n\) with differential
    \[d\colon C_n(A) = A_n \to A_{n-1} = C_{n-1}(A), \quad d(a) = \sum_{i = 0, \dots, n} (-1)^{i} d_i^*(a)\]
    And one can easily check \(d\circ d = 0\).
\end{construction}

\textbf{Note.} The following commutes
\[\begin{tikzcd}
    (\mathbf{Ssets}) \ar[rr, "X \mapsto {C_*(X,A)}"] \ar[rd, "{A[\_]}"] & & (\mathbf{Chains}) \\
    & (\mathbf{s.ab.grps}) \ar[ru, "C_*"] \\
\end{tikzcd}\]

\begin{remark}
    The tensor product of chain complexes \(C,D\) is
    \[(C\otimes D)_n \coloneq \bigoplus_{p+q = n} C_p \otimes D_q\]
    with differential
    \[d(x\otimes y) = (dx \otimes y) + (-1)^p x \otimes (dy)\]
    for \(x \in C_p, y \in D_q\).
\end{remark}

    We can also form the tensor product of simplical abelian groups\index{Tensor product of simplicial abelian groups}:
\begin{defi}{Tensor product of simplicial abelian groups}{}
    \(A,B \colon \Delta^{op} \to (\mathbf{ab.grps})\) by
    \[(A\otimes B)_n = A_n \otimes B_n, \quad \alpha^*\colon (A\otimes B)_n \to (A\otimes B)_m\]
    for \(\alpha\colon [m] \to [n]\) is defined as \(\alpha^*(a\otimes b) = \alpha^*(a) \otimes \alpha^*(b)\) and we write \(\alpha^*_{A\otimes B} \coloneq \alpha^*_A \otimes \alpha^*_B\).

    This can be equally described as the composite
    \[\Delta^{op}\xrightarrow{(A,B)} (\mathbf{ab.grps})\times (\mathbf{ab.grps}) \xrightarrow{\otimes} (\mathbf{ab.grps})\]
\end{defi}    

\textbf{Warning.} For \(A,B \in (\mathbf{SAB}) = \) simplicial abelian groups
\[C_*(A\otimes B) \neq C_*(A) \otimes C_*(B)\]
Also he did this in dimension \(n\), but I lacked time to copy.

The Eilenberg-Zilber theorem is a natural pair of chain homotopy equivalences between these two.

\begin{construction}
    Let \(A,B\) be simplicial chain groups. The \emph{Alexander-Whitney map} is the chain map
    \[AW\colon C_*(A\otimes B) \to C_*(A) \otimes C_*(B)\]
    defined by
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        C_n(A\otimes B) \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "="]\ar[r] & \bigoplus\limits_{p+q = n, p,q \geq 0} A_p \otimes B_q \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "="] \\
        A_n \otimes B_n & C_*(A) \otimes C_*(B)
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    \[AW_n(a\otimes b) = \sum_{p+q = n} d_{front}^*(a) \otimes d_{back}^*(b)\]
    Where \([p] \xrightarrow{d_{front}} [p+q] = [n] \xleftarrow{d_{back}} [q]\).

    You may check for yourself, that this is a chain map, however Schwede didn't do that.
\end{construction}


\newLecture{14.04.2025}

\begin{Remark}
    An example for a simplicial abelian group, that is not of the form
    \[\Delta^{op} \xrightarrow{X} \mathbf{sets} \xrightarrow{A[\_]} (\mathbf{ab. grps.})\]
    is for any abelian group \(G\) the simplicial set \(BG\), that also admits structure of a simplicial abelian group.
\end{Remark}

\begin{remark}[Relation between AW-map and cup-product]
    For a simplicial set \(X\) and ring \(R\),
    \[C^*(X,R) = \Hom(C_*(X,\IZ), R) = \Hom (C_*(\IZ[X])R)\]
    and \(C^n(X,R) = \Hom(C_n(X,R), R)\).
    If \(\psi \in C^n(X,R)\) is a cocycle, i.e. \(d(\psi) = 0\), then it extends to a chain map
    \[\tilde{\psi}\colon C_*(\IZ[X]) \to R[n]\]
    where \(R[n]\) is the complex with \(R\) in dimension \(n\) and \(0\) otherwise.
    and \(\tilde{\psi}\) is \(\psi\) in dimension \(n\) and \(0\) otherwise.

    For \(f \in C^n(X,R), g\in C^m(X,R)\) cocycles, we have \(f\cup g \in C^{n+m}(X,R)\). Then \(\tilde{f\cup g}\) is the following composite
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        {C_*(\IZ[X])} \ar[rr, "{C_*(\IZ[\text{diagonal}])}"] && {C_*(\IZ[X \times X])} \ar[r, "\cong", phantom] & {C_*(\IZ([X]) \otimes \IZ[X])} \ar[dlll, "\text{AW}"] \\
        {C_*(\IZ[X]) \otimes C_*(\IZ[X])} \ar[r, "\tilde{f} \otimes \tilde{g}"] & {R[n] \otimes R[m]} \ar[r, "\text{mult}"] & {R[n+m]} \\
    \end{tikzcd}\]
\end{remark}

\begin{defi}{(p,q)-shuffle}{}
    A \((p,q)\)-shuffle\index{(p,q)-shuffle} for \(p,q \geq 0\) is a permutation \(\sigma\) of \(\set{0,1,\dots, p+q-1}\), such that the restriction of \(\sigma\) to \(\set{0,1,\dots, p-1}\) is monotone, and the restriction of \(\sigma\) to \(\set{p, \dots, p+q-1}\) is monotone.
\end{defi}

\begin{Remark}
    \enquote{Shuffles leave the first \(p\) elements in order and the last \(q\) elements in order.}
\end{Remark}

\begin{example}
    The only \((p,0)\)-shuffle or \((0,q)\)-shuffles are the identity.

    There are precisely two \((1,1)\)-shuffles, namely both permutations of \(\set{0,1}\).

    \(\sigma \in S_3\) given by \(\sigma(0) = 0 \sigma(1) = 2, \sigma(2) = 1\) is not a \((2,1)\)-shuffle, but it is a \((1,2)\)-shuffle.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
    \((p,q)\)-shuffles biject with \(p\)-element subsets of \(\set{0,1,\dots, p+q-1}\) by \(\sigma\mapsto \set{\sigma(0), \dots, \sigma(p)}\) and also wit \(q\)-element subsets of \(\set{0,1, \dots, p+q-1}\) by \(\sigma\mapsto \set{\sigma(p),\dots, \sigma(p+q-1)}\).

    This means \(\abs{(p,q)\text{-shuffles}} = \binom{p+q}{p} = \binom{p+q}{q}\).
\end{remark}

\begin{notation}
    Let \(\sigma\) be a \((p,q)\)-shuffle. We write \(\mu_i\Coloneq \sigma(i-1)\) for \(1 \leq 1 \leq p\) and \(\nu_i \coloneq \sigma(p+i-1)\) for \(1 \leq i \leq q\).

    This means
    \(0 \leq \mu_1 \leq \dots \leq \mu_p\) and \(0 \leq \nu_1 \leq \dots \leq \nu_q \leq p+q-1\).
\end{notation}

\begin{defi}{Eilenberg-Zilber map}{}
    Let \(A,B\) be simplicial abelian groups. The Eilenberg-Zilber map \index{Eilenberg-Zilber map}/shuffle map \index{shuffle map} is
    \[EZ\colon C_*(A) \otimes C_*(B) \to C_*(A\otimes B)\]
    is the direct sum of the homomorphisms
    \[\nabla_{p,q} \colon A_p\otimes B_q \to A_{p+q} \otimes B_{p+q}\]
    given by
    \[a\otimes b \mapsto a \nabla b \coloneq \sum_{\sigma\colon (p,q)\text{-shuffle}} \sgn(\sigma) \cdot (s_{\nu_i} \circ \dots \circ s_{\nu_q})^*(a) \otimes (s_{\mu_1}\circ \dots \circ s_{\mu_p})^*(b)\]
\end{defi}

\begin{example}
    There is only one \((p,0)\)-shuffle, the identity of \(\set{0, \dots, p-1}\). Then \(\mu_i = i-1\).
    \[\nabla_{p,0}\colon A_p \otimes B_0 \to A_p \otimes B_p\]
    is defined by
    \[a\otimes b \mapsto a\nabla b = a \otimes (s_0 \circ \dots \circ s_{p-1})^*(b).\]

    For \(p = q = 1\) i didn't have the time to copy.
\end{example}

Schwede claims, that the Eilenberg-Zilber map is a chain map and he can't believe he actually did those calculations 4 years ago. He will not torture us, but you may watch the videos.

\begin{thm}{Shuffle maps form a chain map}{}
    The shuffle maps \(\nabla_{p,q}\) for varying \(p,q \geq 0\) assemble into a chain map. Furthermore, for \(a \in A_p, b \in B_q\)
    \[d(a\nabla b) = (da) \nabla b + (-1)^p a \nabla (db)\]
\end{thm}

He specifies, that the calculation takes up 8 pages of his notes.


\begin{thm}{Eilenberg-Zilber}{ElbZlb}
    Let \(A,B\) be simplicial abelian groups. Then the morphisms
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        C_*(A) \otimes C_*(B) \ar[rr, bend left, "\text{Eilenberg-Zilber}"] && C_*(A\otimes B) \ar[ll, bend left, "AW"]
    \end{tikzcd}\]

    are mutually inverse natural chain homotopy equivalences.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    A first method of proof would be explicit formulas for the chain homotopies \(\text{AW} \circ EZ \sim \Id\) and \(EZ \circ AW \sim \Id\). That is however infinitely annoying and we will not do this.

    For the special case, where \(A = \IZ[X], B= \IZ[Y]\) for simplicial sets \(X,Y\) we proove this via acyclic models. For that we need some category-theory:

    \begin{proposition}[Yoneda lemma]
        Let \(\cC\) be a category and \(c\) an object of \(\cC\). Let \(F\colon \cC \to (\mathbf{sets})\) be a functor: Then the evaluation map
        \[\Nat_{\cC \to \mathbf{sets}}(\cC(c,\_), F) \to F(c)\]
        given by
        \[(\tau\colon \cC(c,\_) \to F) \mapsto (\tau_c\colon \cC(c,c)\to F(c))(\id_c)\]
        is bijective.

        Equally: for every \(x \in F(c)\), there is a unique natural transformation \(\tau\colon (\cC(c, \_) \to F)\), such that \(\tau_c(\id_c) = x\).
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{Remark}
        A special case of this is
        \[\Hom_{\mathbf{sset}}(\Delta^n, X) \cong X_n, \quad (f\colon \Delta
        ^n\to X) \mapsto f_n(\id_{[n]}).\]
        where \(\Delta^n = \Delta(\_, [n])\).
    \end{Remark}

    \begin{proof}
        We show injectivity and surjectivity.
        \begin{description}
            \item[Injectivity] Let \(\tau\colon \cC(c,\_) \to F\) be any natural transformation. Let \(d\) be another object of \(\cC\), \(f\colon c\to d\) any morphism. Then we have
            \[\tau_d\colon \cC(c,d) \to F(d)\]
            and
            \[\tau_d(f\colon c \to d) = \tau_d(\cC(c,f)(\id_c)) = F(f) (\tau_c(\id_c))\]
            where we use naturality of \(\tau\):
            \[\begin{tikzcd}
                {\cC(c,d)} \ar[r, "\tau_d"] \ar[d, "{\cC(c,g)}"] & F(d) \ar[d, "F(g)"] \\
                {\cC(c,e)} \ar[r, "\tau_e"] & F(e) \\
            \end{tikzcd}\]
            which implies the value of \(\tau\) at \(d,f\colon c\to d\) is determined by its value of \((c, \id_c)\) and the functorality of \(F\).
            \item[Surjectivity] Let \(y \in F(c)\) be given. For an object \(d\) of \(\cC\) and morphism \(f\colon c \to d\), we define
            \[\tau_d\colon \cC(c,d) \to F(d) \quad \tau_d(f) \coloneq F(f)(y).\]
            We check \(\tau_c(\id_c) = F(\id_c)(y) = y\).
            We need to check for naturality. Let \(g\colon d \to e \) be another morphism. Then
            \[\begin{split}
                F(g)(\tau_d(f)) &= F(g)(F(f)(y)) = F(g\circ f)(y) \\
                &= \tau_e(g\circ f) = \tau_e(\cC(c,g)(f)) \\
            \end{split}\]
         \end{description}
    \end{proof}

    Let \(\cC\) be a category, \(c\) an object of \(\cC\). We define the functor \(\IZ[\cC(c,\_)]\colon \cC \to (\mathbf{ab.grps.})\) as the composite
    \[\cC \xrightarrow{\cC(c,\_)} (\mathbf{sets}) \xrightarrow{\IZ[\_]} (\mathbf{ab.grps.}).\]
    In particular, \(\IZ[\cC(c, \_)] (d) = \IZ[\cC(c,d)]\).
    \begin{Proposition}[Additive Yoneda lemma]
        Let \(c \in ob(\cC), F\colon \cC \to (\mathbf{ab.grps.})\) any functor. Then the evaluation map
        \[\Nat_{\cC \to (\mathbf{ab.grps.})}(\IZ[\cC(c,\_)], F) \to F(c)\]
        is bijective. \((\tau\colon \IZ[\cC(c, \_)] \to F) \mapsto \tau_c(1\cdot \id_c)\).
    \end{Proposition}

    \begin{proof}
        For varying objects \(d\) of \(\cC\), the bijections
        \[\Hom_{AB}(\IZ[\cC(c,d)], F(d)) \cong \Hom_{\mathbf{sets}}(\cC(c,d), F(d))\]
        assemble into a bijection\footnote{I don't know why though.}
        \[\Nat_{\cC \to \mathbf{Ab}}(\IZ[\cC(c, \_)], F) \cong \Nat_{\cC \to \mathbf{sets}}(\cC(c, \_), F) \overset{\text{Yoneda}}{\cong} F(c)\]
    \end{proof}

    \begin{defi}{Representable functor}{}
        A functor \(F\colon \cC \to \mathbf{Ab}\) is representable\index{representable functor} if there is an object \(c \in \cC\) and a natural isomorphism \(F\cong \IZ[\cC(c,\_)]\)
    \end{defi}
    \textbf{Note.} Any isomorphism \(F \cong \IZ[\cC(c,\_)]\) is determined by the \enquote{universal element} in \(F(c)\).

    \begin{example}
        Let \(\cC = (\mathbf{ssets}) \times (\mathbf{ssets})\) be the product of two copies of the category of simplicial sets. Define \(f\colon (\mathbf{ssets})\times (\mathbf{ssets}) \to \mathbf{Ab}\) given by \(F(X,Y) = \IZ[X_p \times Y_q]\) for some \(p,q \geq 0\).
        \textbf{Claim.} This functor is representable by \((\Delta^p, \Delta^q)\) with natural isomorphisms.
        \[(\mathbf{ssets}\times \mathbf{ssets})((\Delta^p, \Delta^q), (X,Y)) = \mathbf{sets}(\Delta^p, X) \times \mathbf{sets}(\Delta^q,Y) \cong X_p \times Y_q\]
        Apply free abelian groups to get
        \[\IZ[(\mathbf{ssets} \times \mathbf{ssets})((\Delta^p,\Delta^q)(X,Y))] \cong \IZ[X_P \times Y_q]\]
    \end{example}

    \begin{notation}
        For \(F\colon \cC \to \mathbf{Chains}\) we write \(F_n = (\_)_n \circ F\colon \cC \to \mathbf{Ab}\) as the composite.
        \[\cC \xrightarrow{F} \mathbf{Chains} \xrightarrow{(\_)_n} \mathbf{Ab}\]
        and the second map sends \(C = C(n, d_n)_{n \in \IZ} \mapsto C_n\).
    \end{notation}

    \begin{thm}{Acyclic models}{}
        Let \(\cC\) be a category, \(F,G\colon \cC \to \mathbf{Chains}_+ = \text{non-negative grade chain complexes}\). Let \(\psi \colon F \to G\) be a natural transformation of functors. Suppose;
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The transformation \(\psi_0 \colon F_0 \to G_0 \colon \cC \to \mathbf{Ab}\) is the zero natural transformation
            \item For every \(n \geq 1\), the functor \(F_n \colon \cC \to \mathbf{Ab}\) is isomorphic to a direct sum of representable functors, \(\bigoplus_{i \in I} IZ[\cC(c_i,\_)]\) for some family \(\set{c_i}_{i \in I}\) of \(\cC\)-objects such that \(H_n(G(c_i)) = 0\).
        \end{enumerate}
        Then \(\psi\) is naturally chain nullhomotopic.
    \end{thm}


\newLecture{16.04.2025}

    \begin{proof}
        For \(n \geq 0\), we will construct natural transformations
        \[s_n\colon F_n \to G_{n+1}\]
        of functors \(\cC \to \mathbf{Ab}\), such that
        \begin{equation}\tag{*}
            d_{n+1} \circ s_n + s_{n-1} \circ d_n = \psi_n
        \end{equation}
        as natural transformations (i.e. they have the chain homotopy property).

        The construction is by induction on \(n.\) We begin with \(s_0 = 0\) and \(s_{-1} = 0\). Suppose \(n \geq 1\) and that \(s_0, \dots, s_{n-1}\) have been constructed satisfying (*). Then
        \[d_n^G \circ (\psi_n - s_{n-1} \circ d_n^F) = d_n^G \circ \psi_n - d_n^G \circ s_{n-1} \circ d_n^F\]
        as \(\psi\) is a chain map,
        \[= \psi_{n-1} \circ d_n^F - d_n^G \circ s_{n-1} \circ d_n^F = (\psi_{n-1} - d_n^G \circ s_{n-1}) \circ d_n^F \overset{(*)}{=} s_{n-2} \circ d_{n-1}^F \circ d_n^F = 0.\]
        So \(\psi_n - s_{n-1} \circ d_n^F\colon F_n \to G_n\) takes values in cycles.
        By 2.,
        \[f_n = \bigoplus_{i \in I} \IZ[\cC(c, \_)]\]
        for some set \(\set{c_i}_{i \in I}\) of \(\cC\)-objects, such that \(H_n(G(c_i)) = 0\). Let \(j \in I\), write
        \[x_j \in F(c_j) = \bigoplus_{i \in I} \IZ[\cC(c_i,c_j)]\]
        be the element \(1 \cdot \id_j\) in the \(j\)-th summand. Then
        \[\psi_n^{c_j}(x_j) - s_{n-1}^{{c_j}}(d_n^{F, c_i}(x_j)) \in G_n(c_j)\]
        is a cycle. Since \(H_n(G(c_j)) = 0\), the class is a boundary in the complex \(G(c_j)\).

        Let \(y_j \in G(c_j)_{n+1}\) be a element such that
        \[d_{n+1}^{c_j}(y_j) = \psi_n^{c_j}(x_j) - s_{n-1}^{c_j}(d_n^{F, c_j}(x_j))\]
        The additive Yoneda lemma provides a unique natural transformation
        \[s_{n,j} \colon \IZ[\cC(c_j, \_)] \to G_{n+1}\]
        such that \(s_{n,j}(x_j) = s_{n,j}^{c_j}(1\cdot \id_{c_j}) = y_j \in G_{n+1}(c_j)\).

        We define the natural transformation
        \[s_n\colon F_n = \bigoplus_{i \in I} \IZ[\cC(c_i, \_)] \to G_{n+1}\]
        as \(s_n = \bigoplus_{j \in I} s_{n,j}\).

        It suffices now to show, that (*) holds on each summand \(\IZ[\cC(c_j, \_)]\). By the additive Yoneda lemma, there it suffices to check the relation on \(1\cdot \id_{c_j}\), which holds by definition.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{Remark}
        We only prooved \enquote{half} of the acyclic models theorem. The other half states:

        Let \(\cC\) and \(F,G\colon \cC \to \mathbf{Chains}_+\) be as before, satisfying 2.. Then any natural transformation \(\psi_0\colon F_0 \to G_0\) can be extended to a natural transformation \(\psi\colon F \to G\).
    \end{Remark}

    Now to actually proove the Eilenberg-Zilber-Theorem \ref{thm:elbzlb} (at least in a special case.) Let \(A,B\) be simplicial abelian groups. We assume \(A = C_*(\IZ[X])\), \(B= C_*(\IZ[Y])\) for some simplicial sets \(X,Y\). We write \(C_*(X), C_*(Y)\). For sets \(S,T\),
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        \IZ[S] \otimes \IZ[T] \ar[rr, bend left] && \IZ[S \times T] \ar[ll, bend left] \\
        s\otimes t \ar[rr] && (s,t)
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    is naturally isomorphic. Dimensionwise this gives \(\IZ[X] \otimes \IZ[Y] \cong \IZ[X \times Y]\).

    We want to move this further to \(C_*(X) \otimes C_*(Y) \cong C_*(X\times Y)\).

    \begin{proposition}\leavevmode
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item For all \(p\geq 0\), the simplicial set \(\Delta^q\) is simplicially contractible.
            \item For all \(p \geq 0\), the complex \(C_*(\Delta^p)\) is chain homotopy equivalent to the complex \(\IZ[0]\), the complex consisting of \(\IZ\) in dimension \(0\).
            \item For \(p,q \geq 0\), the chain complex \(C_*(\Delta^p) \otimes C_*(\Delta^q)\) is chain homotopy equivalent to \(\IZ[0]\). In particular,
            \[H_n(C_*(\Delta^p) \otimes C_*(\Delta^q)) = 0\]
            for \(n > 0\).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}\leavevmode
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item We define a morphism of simplicial sets \(H\colon \Delta^p \times \Delta^1 \to \Delta^p\) that contracts \(\Delta^p\) to the last vertex.\footnote{remember, that Homotopy is not symmetric in Simplicial sets. This is such an example.}
            In dimension \(n\),
            \[H_n\colon \Delta([n], [p]) \times \Delta([n],[1]) \to \Delta([n], [p])\]
            is given by
            \[H_n(\alpha, \beta)(i) = \begin{cases}
                \alpha(i) & \text{if } \beta(i) = 0 \\
                p & \text{if } \beta(i) = 1 \\
            \end{cases}\]
            for \(0 \leq i \leq n\). Let \(\gamma\colon [m] \to [n]\) be any morphism in \(\Delta\). Then
            \[H_m(\gamma^*(\alpha,\beta))(j) = H_m(\alpha\circ \gamma, \beta\circ \gamma)(j) = \begin{cases}
                \alpha(\gamma(j)) & \text{if } \beta(\gamma(j)) = 0 \\
                p & \text{if } \beta(\gamma(j)) = 1 \\
            \end{cases} = H_n(\alpha,\beta)(\gamma(j)) = \gamma^*(H_n(\alpha,\beta)(j))\]
            This means \(H\) is a homotopy from \(\Id_{\Delta^p}\) to the composite
            \[\Delta^p \to \Delta^0 \xrightarrow{p\text{-th vertex}} \Delta^p\]
            \item \(C_*\colon \mathbf{ssets} \to \mathbf{chains}\) takes simplicial homotopies to chain homotopies. So we know \(C_*(\Delta^p)\) is chain homotopy equivalent to
            \[C_*(\Delta^0) = (\dots \IZ \xrightarrow{\Id} \IZ \xrightarrow{0} \IZ)\]
            which is chain homotopy equivalent to
            \[(\dots 0 \to 0 \to 0 \to 0 \to \IZ) = \IZ[0]\]

            \item The tensor product of chain complexes preserves chain homotopy equivalences in each variable separatedly. So
            \[C_*(\Delta^p) \otimes C_*(\Delta^q) \sim \IZ[0] \otimes C_*(\Delta^1) \sim \IZ[0] \otimes \IZ[0] \cong \IZ[0].\]
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}

    We now must produce natural chain homotopies from
    \[\mathrm{AW} \circ \mathrm{EZ} \colon C_*(X) \otimes C_*(Y) \to C_*(X) \otimes C_*(Y)\]
    and
    \[\mathrm{EZ} \circ \mathrm{AW}: C_*(X\times Y) \to C_*(X \times Y)\]
    to the respective identities.

    \textbf{Claim.} \(\mathbf{AW}\circ \mathbf{EZ} - \Id_{C_*(X) \otimes C_*(Y)}\colon C_*(X) \otimes C_*(Y) \to C_*(X) \otimes C_*(Y)\) satisfies the hypothesis of acyclic models.

    \begin{proof}
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
            C_0(X) \otimes C_0(Y) \ar[d, phantom, "=", sloped]\ar[r,"\cong", phantom] & \IZ[X_0] \otimes \IZ[Y_0] \ar[r, bend left, "\cong"] & \IZ[X_0 \times Y_0] \ar[l, bend left, "\cong"] \ar[d, "=", phantom, sloped]\\
            (C_*(X) \otimes C_*(Y))_0 && C_0(X\times Y)\\
        \end{tikzcd}\]
        Which means \((\mathbf{AW} \circ \mathbf{EZ})_0 = \Id\) and \((\mathbf{EZ} \circ \mathbf{AW})_0 = \Id\). which means \(\psi_0 = \) zero natural transformation.

        \[(C_*(X) \otimes C_*(Y))_n = \bigoplus_{p+q = n} C_p(X) \otimes C_q(Y) = \bigoplus_{p+q = n} \IZ[X_p] \otimes \IZ[Y_q] \cong \bigoplus_{p+q = n} \IZ[X_p \times Y_q]\]
        which is represented by \((\Delta^p, \Delta^q)\). Then
        \(H_n(C_*(\Delta^p \otimes \Delta^q)) = 0\) (I think, he erased before I could copy.)

        We consider \(\phi \colon \mathbf{EZ} \circ \mathbf{AW} - \Id_{C_*(X\times Y)} \colon C_*(X\times Y) \to C_*(X\times Y)\). We know, \(\phi_0 = 0\). We need to show, that \(\phi\) satisfies the hypothesis of acyclic models.
        \[C_n(X\times Y) = \IZ[X_n \times Y_n]\]
        is representable by \((\Delta^n, \Delta^n)\).
        \[H_n(C_*(\Delta^n\times \Delta^n)) \cong H_n(\Delta^0 \times \Delta^0) = H_n(\Delta^0) = 0\]
        for \(n > 0\), where we used \(\Delta^n \sim \Delta^0\) and so \(\Delta^n \times \Delta^n \sim \Delta^0 \times \Delta^0\). So acyclic models produces a natural chain nullhomotopy of \(\phi\).
    \end{proof}

    This concludes the proof of the K√ºnneth theorem.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Commutativity of the cup-product revisited}

The symmetry isomorphism of chain complexes \(C,D\) is the morphism.
\[\tau_{C,D} \colon C\otimes D \xrightarrow{\cong} D\otimes C\]
is given by
\[\begin{tikzcd}
    {\tau_{C,D}}_n & \colon (C\otimes D)_n & (D\otimes C)_n \\
    & \bigoplus_{p+q = n} C_p \otimes D_q & \bigoplus_{q+p= n} D_q \otimes C_p \\
    & c\otimes d & (-1)^{pq} \cdot d\otimes c
\end{tikzcd}\]

\textbf{Fact.}
\[\begin{tikzcd}
    C_*(X) \otimes C_*(Y) \ar[d, "\tau"] \ar[r, "\mathbf{EZ}"] & C_*(X,Y) \ar[d, "C_*(flip)"] \\
    C_*(Y) \otimes C_*(X) \ar[r, "\mathbf{EZ}"] & C_*(Y\otimes X) \\
\end{tikzcd}\]
commutes. where \(flip \colon X \times Y \to Y \times X, \; (x,y) \mapsto (y,x)\).
Hence, \enquote{The Eilenberg-Zilber map is symmetric}.

But however for AW the same diagram does NOT commute.

%%Diagram

Howeveer it does so up to natural chain homotopy by applying the acyclic models to the differenc of the two composites. He explains, why we can apply acyclic models.

Let \(X\) be a simplicial set. The diagonal \(\Delta\colon X \to X \times X\) is flip-invariant, i.e.
\[\begin{tikzcd}
    X \ar[r, "\Delta"]\ar[rd, "\Delta"] & X\times X \ar[d, "flip"] \\
    & X \times X
\end{tikzcd}\]
We draw a diagram:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
    C_*(X) \ar[r, "C_*(\Delta)"] \ar[rd, "C_*(\Delta)"] & C_*(X\times X) \ar[d, "C_*(flip)"]\ar[r, "\mathbf{AW}"] &C_*(X) \otimes C_*(X) \ar[d, "\tau"]\\
    & C_*(X\times X) \ar[r, "\mathbf{AW}"]& C_*(X) \otimes C_*(X) \\
\end{tikzcd}\]
that commutes up to homotopy. We apply the functor \(\Hom(\_, R)\) to get a new diagram and my speed at copying was not capable of keeping up. You may want to have a look at the videos for this.


\newLecture{23.04.2025}


The Plan for today is to show the K√ºnneth theorem for homology. The rough approximation is, that product of spaces goes to Tensorproducts of abelian groups.

If \(X,Y\) are simplicial sets, then by EZ we have \(H_*(X\times Y; R) = H_*(C_*(X\times Y; R)) \cong H_*((C_*(X,R)) \otimes_R C_*(Y; R))\) and we want to see how that relates to \(H_*(X,R) \otimes_R H_*(Y; R)\).

In the following \(R\) is a commutative ring (have integers and fields in mind).

\begin{defi}{Tensor Product of \(R\)-chains}{}
Let \(C,D\) be chain complexes of \(R\)-modules. We define a new complex of \(R\)-modules \(C \otimes_R D\):
\[(C\otimes_R D)_n = \bigoplus_{p+q = n} C_p \otimes_R D_q\]
with differential
\[d(x\otimes y) = dx \otimes y + (-1)^{pq} x\otimes dy.\]
\end{defi}

Note that \(R \otimes \IZ[S] \cong R[S]\) for \(S\) a simplicial set. And \(R[S] \otimes_R R [T] \cong R[S\times T]\) for \(S,T\) simplicial sets.

For \(X,Y\) simplicial sets, we have
\[R\otimes C_*(X,\IZ) \otimes C_*(Y,\IZ) \xrightarrow{R\otimes \mathbf{EZ}} R\otimes C_*(X\times Y; \IZ) \cong C_*(X\otimes Y; R)\]
and for \(R\otimes C_*(X; \IZ) \otimes C_*(Y; \IZ) \cong (R\otimes C_*(X;Z)) \otimes_R (R \otimes C_*(Y; \IZ)) = C_*(X,R) \otimes_R C_*(Y,R)\), so we get a Eilenberg-Zilber map
\[C_*(X,R)\otimes_R C_*(Y,R) \xrightarrow{\mathbf{EZ}} C_*(X\times Y; R)\]

\textbf{Aim.} relate \(H_*(C\otimes_R D)\) to \(H_*(C), H_*(D)\). Our bope is to have a map
\[\bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(C) \otimes_R H_q(D) \xrightarrow{???} H_n(C\otimes_R D)\]

For example taking \(R = \IZ\) and \(C = D = (\dots ,\ra 0\ra \IZ \xrightarrow{\cdot 2}\IZ \ra 0)\). Then
\[H_n(C) = H_n(D) = \begin{cases}
    \IZ/2 & n = 0 \\
    0 & n \neq 0 \\
\end{cases}\]
but \(C \otimes D = (0\ra 0 \ra \IZ \ra \IZ^2 \ra \IZ \ra 0)\). And 
\[H_1(C\otimes D) = \set{(x,-x) \in \IZ}/\set{(2y, -2y) \mid y\in \IZ} \cong \IZ/2 \neq 0\]

\begin{defi}{Projective \(R\)-modules}{}
    An \(R\)-module \(P\) is \emph{projective}\index{Projective Module} if for every epimorphism \(\varepsilon \colon M\to N\) of \(R\)-modules, the map
    \[\Hom(P, \varepsilon) \colon \Hom(P, M) \to \Hom(P, N)\]
    is surjective.
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        & M \ar[d, "\varepsilon", two heads] \\
        P \ar[ru, dotted] \ar[r, "f"] & N \\
    \end{tikzcd}\]
\end{defi}

\textbf{Fact.} \(P\) is projective iff \(P\) is a direct summand of a free modulo iff there exists a \(R\)-module \(Q\) and a set \(S\), such that
\[P \oplus Q \cong R[S].\]

\begin{proof}
    Free modulse are projective:
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        & M \ar[d, "\varepsilon", two heads] \\
        R[S] \ar[r, "f"] \ar[ru, dotted, "g"] & N \\
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    for every \(s \in S\) choose \(m_s \in M\) \(\varepsilon(m_s) = f(s)\). Then there is a unique homomorphism \(g\colon R[S] \to M\) such that \(g(s) = m_s\).
    
    Let \(P\) be projective and \(Q\) a summand of \(P\). For reasons I couldn't copy, then \(Q\) is also projective.

Let \(P\) be a projective \(R\)-modulo. Consider the epimorphism
\[\begin{split}
    R[P ] &\to P \\
    p &\mapsto p
\end{split}\]

Then we have
\[\begin{tikzcd}
    & R[P] \ar[d, two heads] \\
    p \ar[ru, dotted, "g"] \ar[r, "\id"] & P \\
\end{tikzcd}\]
So \(P\) is a direct summand of \(R[P]\).

\end{proof}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(R\) is a field, then all modules are free, hence projective.
    \item \(R = \IZ/6\), \(P = \IZ/2, Q = \IZ/3\). Then \(\IZ/6 \cong \IZ/2\oplus \IZ/3\), so, as \(\IZ/6\) is free, \(\IZ/2\) and \( \IZ/3\) are projective, but not free.
\end{itemize}

\begin{proposition}
    Let \(R\) be a commutative ring, and
    \[0 \ra I \xrightarrow{\alpha} M \xrightarrow{\beta} N \to 0\]
    be a short exact sequence of \(R\)-modules.

    Then for every \(R\)-module \(P\), the sequence
    \[P\otimes_R I \xrightarrow{P\otimes_R \alpha} P \otimes_R M \xrightarrow{p\otimes_R \beta} P\otimes_R N \to 0\]
    is exact. (\enquote{\(P \otimes_R \_\) is right exact}). If moreover \(P\) is projective, then it is also exact with a \(0\) on the left, i.e. \(P\otimes_R \alpha\) is injective. (\enquote{projective modules are flat}).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    \[p\otimes_R \beta) \circ (p\otimes_R) \alpha = P\otimes_r (\beta\circ \alpha) = P\otimes_R 0 = 0\]
    so \(\Img(P\otimes_R \alpha) \subseteq \ker(P\otimes_R \beta)\) so we get an induced homomorphism
    \[\gamma \frac{P\otimes_R M}{\Img(P\otimes_R \alpha)} \to P\otimes_R N\]
    exactness is equivalent to \(\delta\) being an isomorphism.
    We define a homomorphism \(\delta\colon P\otimes_R N \to \frac{P\otimes_R M}{\Img(P\otimes_R \alpha)}\)given by \((p,n) \in P\otimes N\) choose \(\tilde n \in M\), such that \(\beta(\tilde n) = n\).

    \textbf{Claim.} \(\delta(p\otimes n) = p\otimes \tilde n + \Img(P\otimes_R \alpha)\) is independent of choice of \(\tilde n\)
    \begin{proof}
        Let \(\tilde\tilde n \in M\) also satisfy \(\beta(\tilde{\tilde n}) = n\). Then \(\beta(\tilde{\tilde n} - \tilde n) = 0\), so there is \(i \in I\) s.t. \(\alpha(i) = \tilde{\tilde n} - \tilde n\). \(p \otimes \tilde{\tilde n} - p\otimes \tilde n = p\otimes (\tilde{\tilde n} - \tilde n) = p\otimes \alpha(i) \in \Img(P\otimes_R \alpha)\).
    \end{proof}

    \textbf{Claim.} The assignment of \(\delta\) is biadditive and sends \((rp,n)\) and \((p, rn)\) to the same element.

    Then this extends to a well defined \(R\)-linear map
    \[P\otimes_R N \to \frac{P\otimes_R M}{\img(P\otimes_R \alpha)}\]
    which is isomorphic.

    Now let \(P\) be projective. We show that then \(P \otimes_R \alpha\) is injective.

    \begin{description}
        \item[Case 1] \(P = R[S]\) free, \(S\) some set. Then
        \[P \otimes_R M = R[S] \otimes_R M \cong \bigoplus{s \in S} M\]
        we have a natural isomorphism of \(R\)-modules in \(M\).

        From this we get a commutative square of \(R\)-modules:
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
            P\otimes_R I \ar[d, "\cong", sloped, phantom] \ar[r, "P\otimes_R \alpha"] & P\otimes_R M \ar[d, "\cong", phantom, sloped] \\
            \bigoplus_{s\in S} I \ar[r, "\bigoplus_{s \in S} \alpha"] & \bigoplus_{s \in S} M \\
        \end{tikzcd}\]
        where the bottom map is injective.
        \item[General case] \(P\) projective is a summand of a free module \(F\), i.e. there are homomorphisms
        \[P \xrightarrow{\lambda} F \xrightarrow{\mu} P\]
        s.t. \(\mu\circ \lambda = \Id_P\). We consider thee commutative square
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
            P\otimes_R I \ar[d, "\lambda\otimes_R I"]\ar[r, "P\otimes_R \alpha"] & P\otimes_R N \ar[d, "\lambda\otimes_R N"]\\
            F \otimes_R I \ar["F \otimes_R \alpha", r] & F\otimes_R N \\
        \end{tikzcd}\]
        where the bottom map is injective by Case 1 and \(\lambda \otimes_R I\) is injective, as it admits a retraction.
    \end{description}
\end{proof}

\begin{defi}{Global dimension of rings}{}
    A commutative ring \(R\)\index{Global dimension} has global dimension \(\leq 1\) if every submodule of a projective module is projective.
\end{defi}

\begin{example} Some rings with global dimension \(\leq 1\) are
    \begin{itemize}
        \item fields 
        \item the ring of integers \(\IZ\) (subgroups of free abelian groups are free).
        \item every PID\footnote{no zero divisors and every ideal is generated by a single element.} is of this form. See for example \(k[x]\) for \(k\) a field or \(\IZ[i]\) the gaussian integers
        \item \(\IZ_p\) the \(p\)-adic integers.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{defi}{Tor of nice rings}{}
    Let \(R\) be a commutative ring of global dimension \(\leq 1\). Let \(M,N\) be \(R\)-modules. Choose an epimorphism \(p\colon P \to N\) of \(R\)-modules with \(P\) projective. Define
    \[\Tor^R(M,N) = \Ker(M\otimes_R N \xrightarrow{M\otimes_R incl} M\otimes_R P)\]
\end{defi}

\textbf{Facts.} This is independent up to preferred isomorphism of the choice of \(p\colon P \to N\).

It is symmetric, i.e. we can resolve \(M\) instead of \(N\).

If \(P\) is projective, then \(\Tor^R(P,N) = 0 = \Tor^R(M,P)\).

\begin{construction}
    For \(R\) a commutative ring, \(C,D\) complexes of \(R\)-modules. We define a natural homomorphism
    \[\Phi \colon H_p(C) \otimes_R H_q(D) \to H_{p+q}(C\otimes R D)\]
    via \([x] \otimes [y] \mapsto [x\otimes y]\)
\end{construction}

We can check this is well defined.

\begin{thm}{Algebraic K√ºnneth theorem}{}
    Let \(R\) be a commutative ring of global dimension \(\leq 1\). Let \(C, D\) be complexes of projective \(R\)-modules. Then the following map is \(R\)-linearly split injective
    \[\bigoplus \Phi \colon \bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(C) \otimes_R H_q(D) \to H_n(C \otimes_R D)\]
    Moreover the cokernel is naturally isomorphic to
    \[\bigoplus_{p+q = n-1} \Tor^R(H_p(C), H_q(D)).\]

    Equivalently, there is a natural and split short exact sequence
    \[0 \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(C) \otimes_R H_q(D) \xrightarrow{\Phi} H_n(C\otimes D) \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n-1} \Tor^R(H_p(C), H_q(D)) \to 0\]
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    We let \(Z = \set{Z_q}_{q\in \IZ}\) be the comples of \(R\) modules with \(d = 0\) where \(Z_q = \Ker(d\colon D_q \to D_{q-1})\), let \(B = \set{B_q}\) be the complex with \(d = 0\) where \(B_q = \Img(D\colon D_{q+1} \to D_q)\). We have a short exact sequence of complexes of \(R\)-modules
    \[0 \to Z \xrightarrow{incl} D \xrightarrow{d} B[1] \to 0\]
    where \(B[1]\) is the complex \(B\) shilfted up by 1.

    We have \(B_q \subseteq Z_q \subseteq D_q\) projective by hypothesis. Since \(R\) has global dimension \(\leq 1\), \(B_q\) and \(Z_q\) are also projective.
    \[0 \to Z_q \to D_q \xrightarrow{d} B_{q-1} \to 0\]
    is hort exact, \(B_{q-1}\) is projective, so the sequence splits.

    For every \(R\)-module \(N\), the sequence
    \[0 \to N\otimes_R Z_p \to N\otimes_R D_q \to N\otimes_R B_{q-1} \to 0\]
    is exact.

    This means we get a short exact sequence of complexes
    \[0 \to C\otimes_R Z \to C\otimes_R D \to C\otimes_R B[1] \to 0\]

    This means we get a long exact homology sequence
    \[\to H_n(C\otimes_R Z) \xrightarrow{H_n(C\otimes_R incl)} H_n(C\otimes D) \xrightarrow{H_n(C\otimes d)} H_{n-1}(C\otimes_R B) \xrightarrow{\partial} H_{n-1}(C\otimes_R Z) \to \dots\]
    Since \(Z\) has trivial differential:
    \[H_n(C\otimes_R Z) = H_n(\bigoplus_{q \in \IZ} C[q] \otimes Z_q) \cong \bigoplus_{q \in \IZ} H_n(C[q]\otimes Z_q) \cong \bigoplus_{q \in \IZ} H_n(C[q]) \otimes_R Z_q = \bigoplus_{p \in \IZ} H_{n-q}(C) \otimes_R Z_q\]
    where we use that \(Z_q\) is projective.

    Similarly \(H_n(C\otimes_R B) \cong \bigoplus_{q\in \IZ} H_{n-q}(C) \otimes B_q\).

    This gives us a long exact sequence
    \[\dots \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(C) \otimes_R Z_q \to H_n(C\otimes_R D) \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n-1} H_p(C) \otimes B_q \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n-1} H_p(C) \otimes Z_q\]
    This splits up into short exact sequences
    \[0 \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n} \Coker(H_p(C) \otimes B_q \to H_p(C) \otimes_R Z_p) \to H_n(C\otimes_R D) \to \bigoplus_{p+q =n-1} \Ker(H_p(C) \otimes_R B_q \to H_p(C) \otimes Z_q) \to 0\]
    We know \(0 \to B_q \to Z_q \to H_q(D)\) is a projective resolution of \(H_q(D)\).

    This means for all \(R\)-modules \(N\),
    \[\Tor^R(N; H_q(D)) = \Ker(N\otimes_R B_q \to N\otimes_R Z_q)\]
    \[N\otimes_R H_q(D) \cong \Coker(N\otimes_R B_q \to N\otimes_R Z_q)\]
    So we get:
    \[0 \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(C) \otimes H_q(D) \xrightarrow{\Phi} H_n(C\otimes_R D) \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n-1} \Tor^R(H_p(C), H_q(D)) \to 0\]

    for next lecture remains, that \(\Phi\) has a \(R\)-linear retraction!

\newLecture{28.04.2025}

    For the \(R\)-linear spitting.

    Because \(B_q\) is projective, the following s.e.s. splits:
    \[0 \to Z_q \xrightarrow{\incl} D_q \xrightarrow{d}  B_q \to 0\]
    and the map \(Z_q\) to \(D_q\) admits a retraction. We choose a retraction \(r_q\colon D_q \to Z_q\) to the inclusion.

    Then
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        D_q+1 \ar[d, "d"] \ar[rrdd, bend left, "0"] & & \\
        B_q  \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "\subseteq "] \ar[rrd, "0"] \ar[dr, "="] & & \\
        D_q \ar[r, "r_q"] & Z_q  \ar[r] & H_q(D) \\
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    the retraction \(\set{r_q}_{q \in \IZ}\) for a morphism of chain complexes
    \[r\colon D \to \set{H_q(D), d = 0}_q\]
    that induces the identity on homology.

    \(H_q(r) \cong H_q(D) \to H_q(H_*(D), d= 0) = H_q(D)\).
    Similalry, there is a chain map \(\rho\colon C \to \set{H_p(C), d = 0}\) that is the identity on homology. This gives a chain mpa \(\rho \otimes_R r\colon C \otimes_R D \to (H_*(C) \otimes_R H_*(D), d= 0)\) which on homology
    \[H_n(\rho\otimes_r r) \colon H_n(C \otimes_R D) \to H_n(H_*(C) \otimes RH_*(D), d= 0) = \bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_n(C) \otimes_R H_n(D)\]
    which is a retraction to
    \[\Psi \colon \bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(C) \otimes_R H_q(D) \to H_n(C\otimes R D)\]

\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    Let \(R\) be a field. Then every module is free, hence projective, and
    \[\Tor^R(M,N) = 0\]
    for all \(R\)-modules M,N. For all complexes of \(R\)-modules C,D;
    \[\psi\colon \bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(C) \otimes_R H_q(D) \xrightarrow{\cong} H_n(C\otimes_R D).\]
    is an isomorphism.

    If \(R = \IZ\). Let \(C,D\) be a complex of free abelian groups. Then there is a split s.e.s.
    \[0 \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(C) \otimes H_q(D) \to H_n(C\otimes D) \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n-1} \Tor(H_p(C), H_q(D)) \to 0\]
\end{example}

\begin{construction}[Homology exterior pairing]
    Let \(X,Y\) be simplicial sets. Let \(R\) be a commutative ring. We define
    \[\times \colon H_p(X,R) \otimes_R H_q(Y,R) \to H_{p+q} (X\times Y, R)\]
    as the composite
    \[H_p(C_*(X,R)) \otimes_R H_q(C_*(Y; R)) \xrightarrow{\Phi} H_{p+q}(C_*(X, R) \otimes C_*(Y,R)) \xrightarrow{H_{p+q}(\mathrm{EZ})} H_{p+q}(C_*(X\times Y, R))\]
    
    For topological spaces \(A,B\) we Define
    \[\times \colon H_p(A; R) \otimes _R H_q(B,R) \to H_{p+q}(A\times B, R)\]
    as the composite
    \[H_p(\cS(A),R) \otimes_R H_q(\cS(B),R) \xrightarrow{\times} H_{p+q}(\cS(A) \otimes \cS(B), R) \cong H_{p+q}(\cS(A\times B); R)\]
    where the isomorphism is given by the fact, that simplical complex commutes with products. The isomorphism is the canonical map
    \[\cS(A) \times \cS(B) \xleftarrow{(\cS(p_A), \cS(p_B))} \cS(A\times B)\]
\end{construction}

\begin{thm}{K√ºnneth theorem for homology with field coefficients}{}
    Let \(R\) be a field. Let \(X,Y\) be simplicial sets or spaces. Then the homology external product
    \[\times \colon \bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(X,R) \otimes_R H_q(X,R) \to H_n(X\times Y; R)\]
    is an isomorphism.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Follows directly from algebraic K√ºnneth + Eilenberg-Zilber
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}{K√ºnneth theorem for homology}{}
    Let \(X,Y\) be spaces or simplicial sets. Then there is a natural and split s.e.s. 
    \[0 \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(X, \IZ) \otimes H_q(Y, \IZ) \to H_n(X\times Y; \IZ) \to \bigoplus_{p+q = n-1} \Tor(H_p(X,\IZ) , H_q(Y, \IZ)) \to 0\]
\end{thm}

\textbf{Special Case.} Let \(X, Y\) be spaces or simplical sets. Suppose that \(H_n(X, \IZ)\) is free for all \(n \geq 0\). Then
\[\bigoplus_{p+q = n} H_p(X, \IZ) \otimes H_q(Y, \IZ) \xrightarrow{\Phi} H_n(X\times Y; \IZ)\]
is an isomorphism.

Next we want to show the K√ºnneth theorem for cohomology. The strategy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item EZ provides a chain homotopy equilvalence \(C_*(X, \IZ) \otimes C_*(Y, \IZ)\) to \(C_*(X\times Y, \IZ)\).
    \item \(\Hom(\_, R) \colon \mathbf{Chains} \to \mathbf{coChains}_R\) preserves chain homotopies, so
    \[\Hom(C_*(X, \IZ), R) \otimes \Hom(C_*(Y, \IZ), R) \cong \Hom((C_*(X\times Y), \IZ), R)\]
    \item in favorable cases we can relate
    \[H^*(\Hom(C, R) \otimes_R \Hom(D, R)) \text{ to } H^*(\Hom(C,R)) \otimes_R H^*(\Hom(D,R))\]
    \item apply the algebraic K√ºnneth theorem.
\end{itemize}

Step 3 is the hard step.

\subsection{Relation between Homs and Tensors}

Let \(A\) be an abelian group and \(R\) an commutative ring. We make the set \(\Hom(A,R)\) of group homomorphisms into an \(R\) module by pointwise addition and skalar multiplication. So \(f,g \in \Hom(A,R)\), \(r \in R\). then
\[(f+g)(a) = f(a) + g(a), \quad ((r\cdot f)(a) = r\cdot f(a))\]
Let \(B\) be another abelian group. Then
\[\bullet \colon \Hom(A,R) \times \Hom(B,R) \to \Hom(A\otimes B, R)\]
by \((f\bullet g)(a\otimes b) = f(A) \cdot g(b)\). This is additive in \(f\) and \(g\).
\[(f+f') \bullet g = (f\bullet g) + (f' \bullet g)\]
and
\[(rf) \bullet g = r \cdot (f\bullet g) = f \bullet (r\cdot g)\]
for all \(r \in R\).
This means this extends to a well-defined \(R\)-linear map
\[\Hom(A,R) \otimes_R \Hom(B,R) \to \Hom(A\otimes B, R)\]
\begin{proposition}
    Let \(A,B\) be abelian groups and \(R\) a commutative ring. If \(A\) is finitely generated and free, then
    \[\Hom(A, R) \otimes_R \Hom(B,R) \to \Hom(A\otimes B, R)\]
    is an isomorphism of \(R\)-modules.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    For \(A = \IZ\):
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        {\Hom(\IZ,R) \otimes_R \Hom(B,R)} \ar[r, "\bullet"] \ar[d, "{\mathrm{ev} \otimes_R \Hom(B,R)}"] & {\Hom(\IZ\otimes B, R)} \ar[d, "{\cong \; \Hom(k,R)}"]\\
        {R \otimes_R \Hom(B,R)} \ar[r, "\cong", "r\otimes g \mapsto r\cdot g"'] & {\Hom(B,R)}
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    where we have \(k \colon B \to \IZ \otimes B\) with \(b\mapsto 1 \otimes b\).

    Suppose the claim holds for \(A\) and \(A'\). Then it holds for \(A \oplus A'\).
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        {\Hom(A\oplus A*, R) \otimes_R \Hom(B,R)} \ar[r, "\bullet"] \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "\cong"]& {\Hom((A\oplus A') \otimes B, R)} \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "\cong"] \\
        {(\Hom(A,R) \oplus \Hom(A',R)) \otimes_R \Hom(B,R)} \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "\cong"] & {\Hom((A\otimes B) \oplus (A' \otimes B), R)} \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "\cong"]\\
        {(\Hom(A,R) \otimes_R \Hom(B,R)) \bigoplus (\Hom(A',R) \otimes_R \Hom(B,R))} \ar[r, "\cong \; \text{by assumption}"]&  {\Hom(A\otimes B, R) \oplus \Hom(A' \otimes B, R)} &\\
    \end{tikzcd}\]

    The claim holfs for \(A = \IZ^k\), \(k \in \IN\). any finitely generated free abelian group is isomorphic to \(\IZ^k\).
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    \begin{description}
        \item[\(R = \IF_2\)] \(A = B= \IZ[\IN]\). Then \(\Hom(\IZ[\IN], R) \cong \mathrm{maps}(\IN, R)\) by evaluation of generators. This is \(R\)-linear by the \(R\)-module structure on \(\mathrm{maps}(\IN, R)\).
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
            \Hom(A,R) \otimes \Hom(B,R) \ar[r, "\bullet"] & \Hom(A\otimes B, R) \\
            \mathrm{maps}(\IN,R) \otimes_R \mathrm{maps}(\IN, R) & \Hom(\IZ[\IN \times \IN], R) \\
            & \mathrm{maps}(\IN \times \IN, R)
        \end{tikzcd}\]
        This is however not an isomorphism.

        \item[] \(A = B = \IZ/2\) and \(R = \IZ/4\). Then \(\Hom(A,R) = \Hom(B,R) = \Hom(\IZ/2, \IZ/4)\) is cyclif of order two generate by \(i \colon \IZ/2 \to \IZ/4\), \(n +2\IZ \mapsto 2n + 4\IZ\).
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
            \Hom(A,R) \otimes_R \Hom(B,R) \ar[r, "\bullet"] \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "="] & \Hom(A\otimes B, R) \\
            \Hom(\IZ/2, \IZ/4) \otimes_{\IZ/4} \Hom(\IZ/2, \IZ/4) \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "\cong"] & \Hom(\IZ/2 \otimes \IZ/2, \IZ/4) \ar[d, phantom, sloped, "\cong"]\\
            \IZ/2 \ar[r, "0"] & \IZ/2 \\
        \end{tikzcd}\]
    \end{description}
\end{example}

This shows, that both assumptions are strictly necessary.

Now let \(C,D\) be complexes of abelian groups. Then \(\Hom(C,R), \Hom(D,R)\) are cochian complexes of \(R\)-modules.
\[\Hom(C,R)^n = \Hom(C_n,R)\]
and
\[d^n \colon \Hom(C,R)^n \to \Hom(C,R^{n+1}) = \Hom(D_{n+1}, R)\]
The sum of the \(\bigoplus\) homomorphism gives a cochain map
\[\bigoplus \colon \Hom(C,R) \otimes_R \Hom(D,R) \to \Hom(C\otimes D, R)\]
which is in dimension \(n\):
\[\bigoplus_{p+q = n} \Hom(C_p,R) \otimes_R \Hom(D_q, R) \xrightarrow{\text{sum of } \bigoplus} \Hom(\bigoplus_{p+q = n} C_p \otimes D_q, R)\]

\begin{proposition}
    Let \(C\) and \(D\) be chain complexes of abelian groups, such that \(C_n = 0 = D_n\) for \(n < 0\) and that \(C_n\) is finitely generated and free for all \(n \geq 0\). Then \(\bigoplus\) is an isomorphism.
    \[\bigoplus\colon \Hom(C,R) \otimes \Hom(D,R) \to \Hom(C\otimes D, R)\]
    is an isomorphism of cochain complexes.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    The vanishing hypothesis makes the potentially infinte sums
    \[\bigoplus_{p+q = n} \Hom(C_p, R) \otimes_R \Hom(D_q, R)\]
    finite.

    Then \(\Hom(\_, R)\) preserves sums. And
    \[\Hom(C_p, R) \otimes \Hom(D_q,R) \xrightarrow{\bigoplus} \Hom(C_p \otimes D_q; R)\]
    is an isomorphism by the previous proposition.
\end{proof}

This is not yet good enough to apply to topological spaces, as they are very not finitely generated.

\begin{proposition}
    Let \(C\) be a chain complex of free abelian groups, such that  \(C_n = 0\) for \(n < 0\). Suppose that \(H_n(C)\) is finitely generated for all \(n > 0\).

    Then there is a subcomplex \(B\) of \(C\), such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(B_n\) is finitely generated and free for all \(n \geq 0\).
        \item The inclusion \(B \to C\) is a chain homotopy equivalence.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    We construct subgroups \(B_n\) of \(C_n\) by induction on \(n \geq 0\), such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item     \(d(B_n) \subseteq B_{n-1}\)
        \item the inclusions of \(0 \to B_n \xrightarrow{d} \to B_{n-1} \xrightarrow{d} \dots \to B_0 \to 0\)
        \item into \(C\) induces an isomorphism on \(H_i\) for all \(0 \leq i \leq n-1\) and an epimorphism on \(H_n\).
    \end{itemize} 

    Induction start: Let \(x_1, \dots, x_m\) be elements of \(C_0\), that generate \(H_0(C)\). Select \(B_0\) to be the subgroups of \(C_0\) generated by \(x_1, \dots, x_m\).

    Induction step: Suppose \(B_0, \dots, B_{n-1}\) have been constructed fullfilling the conditions.
    Let \(x_1, \dots, x_m\) be cycles in \(C_n\) whose homology classes generate \(H_n(C)\), which is possible because \(H_n(C)\) is finitely generated. Set
    \[Z = \Ker(d\colon B_{n-1} \to B_{n-2}) \cap \img(d\colon C_n \to C_{n-1})\]
    which is finitely generated because \(B_{n-1}\) is. Let \(z_1, \dots, z_k\) generate this intersection. Choose \(y_1, \dots, y_k \in C_n\), such that \(d(y_i) = z_i\) for \(1 \leq i \leq k\).

    Let \(B_n\) be the subgroup generated by \(x_1, \dots, x_m, y_1, \dots, y_k\). Then \(d(B_n) \subseteq B_{n-1}\).

    Let \(B_{\leq n}\) and \(B_{< n}\) be the subcomplexes of \(C\) generated by \(B_0, \dots, B_n\) and \(B_0, \dots, B_{n-1}\)

    Then \(B_{<n} \subseteq B_{\leq n} \subseteq C\) where \(B_{ < n}\) induces isomorphism on \(H_i\) for \(0 \leq i \leq n-2\) and epi on \(H_{n-1}\). Similarly \(B_{<n} \to B_{\leq n}\) is iso in dimension \(\leq n-1\).

    Then \(B_{\leq n}\) is an Isomorphism on \(H_i\) for \(0 \leq i \leq n-2\) and surjective on \(H_n\) because we include \(x_1, \dots, x_m\) that generate \(H_n(C)\).

    Let \(x \in B_{n-1}\) be any cycle whose class is in the kernel of \(H_{n-1}(B_{<n}) \to H_{n-1}(C)\). Then \(x \in Z\) so \(x\) is a linear combination of the classes \(z_1, \dots, z_k\) and hence a boundary of a linear combination of \(y_1, \dots, y_k\). So \(x = d(w)\) for some \(w \in B_n\). Then 
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        &H_{n-1}(B_n) \ar[rd] & \\
        H_{n-1}(B_{<n}) \ar[ru] \ar[rr]& & H_{n-1}(C)
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    the class of \(x\) maps to 0 and the map becomes injective and hence an isomorphism.

    We let \(B\) be the subcomplex of \(C\) generated by all \(B_i\) for all \(i \geq 0\). Then the inclusion \(B \to C\) induces an isomorphism on \(H_i\) for all \( i \geq 0\), so it is a quasi-isomorphism.

    By the end of last term we prooved, it is already a chain homotopy equivalence!
\end{proof}
